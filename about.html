                    My name is Logan Garzonio, I am a 6ft 3in swimmer at Milligan University and I am an upcoming senior at said college. I am studying Computer Science and Information Systems here at Milligan. Some things about my hobbies that make up for who I am include playing and collecting Magic the Gathering cards, playing playstation with my friends and family and finally thinking up mock designs for future video games as well as attempting at writing the code for them. These hobbies are what help me be me as well as help me to have fun more often.
